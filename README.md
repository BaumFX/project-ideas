a python script that helps you find more ideas for coding projects.

## getting started

these instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

install praw
```
pip install --upgrade praw
```
for access to the reddit api

register a script in your reddit preferences

you can then use

```
python script.py
```
to get a random idea from a random subreddit of your choice (edit amount of posts to fetch and subreddit list in script.py)

all data is saved to the file idea.txt

## todo:
maybe add some user input to alter the settings?

caching?
